Because grep doesn't know how to handle |. Get ready for some nasty escaping:

statement = """sh -c 'grep thing file | grep thing2 | tail -1'"""
This creates a shell on the other side, and asks it to interpret the string grep thing file | grep thing2 | tail -1. The single quotes are necessary since sh -c accepts only a single argument.

That way, a shell will create the pipe for you, running all the commands. And you better be sure that the filename file doesn't contain spaces. If it does, try "file".

Each character in a string is assigned a number. This number is called the index. Check out the diagram in the editor.

c = "cats"[0]
n = "Ryan"[3]

    In the above example, we create a new variable called c and set it to "c", the character at index zero of the string "cats".
    Next, we create a new variable called n and set it to "n", the character at index three of the string "Ryan".

In Python, we start counting the index from zero instead of one.

Note for C++/Java/C# Programmers
The self in Python is equivalent to the this pointer in C++ and the this reference in Java and C#.

class TestAnonymousSurvey(unittest.TestCase):
	def setUp(self):
		self.responses = ['English','Spanish','Mandarin']
		
		
	def test_store_single_response(self):
		self.my_survey.store_response(self.responses[0])
	
	
	

Line 3 is prefixed by self, so they can be used anywhere in the class.

The prefix self
		Any variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class, and we'll also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class.

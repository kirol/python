Currently, you can only stop the tests at the suite level. Once you are in a TestCase, the stop() method for the TestResult is not used when iterating through the tests.

Somewhat related to your question, if you are using python 2.7, you can use the -f/--failfast flag when calling your test with python -m unittest. This will stop the test at the first failure.

See 25.3.2.1. failfast, catch and buffer command line options

You can also consider using Nose to run your tests and use the -x, --stop flag to stop the test early.
